            <h2>Week 1 Highlights</h2>
            <p>Accomplishments Preliminary Research: Before our first meeting my primary goal was to familiarize myself with the various technologies that will be used in our Drone and get a basic understanding of how these systems will work in real time. After the meeting, we decided to assign research topics for each of the members. I assigned myself to look into sourcing the kayak/skiff base (or hull) as well as the different radar systems how they function and could interface with other hardware.</p>
            <h3>Kayak</h3>
            <p>In terms of possible test beds, we want a stable base that will have ample mounting space as well as the possibility of an already integrated motor that we can manipulate to interface with an autonomous system. A few options of size in pricing are listed below:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/AQUOS-Inflatable-Stainless-Freshwater-Saltwater/dp/B099DBZPD9?th=1">AQUOS Inflatable Pontoon Boat ($700)</a>: This boat provides a simple “barebones” design that can be adjusted to fit our sensors and devices.</li>
                <li><a href="https://hizano.myshopify.com/products/2024-epdl-old-town-sportsman-bigwater-132-fishing-kayak-battery-is-included?currency=USD&variant=46422064562454&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=Google%20Shopping&stkn=fbb573f930b5&srsltid=AfmBOorMvgLx4gT8gmVqZbSQvPXZFBglsJ5ra-tO-v_ubzhYSE3Pbq-Jkvk">2024 EPDL 132 FISHING KAYAK ($600)</a>: This fishing kayak includes a trolling motor and mounting holes for various racks. Ideally, we find something in this price range with similar features.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Radar</h3>
            <p>As for sourcing radar, I have just done some small amount of research to understand how it functions. I am also looking into which companies offer certain commercial radar systems.

            <h2>Next Week's Goals</h2>
            <p>Goals (short term): Right now my goal is to narrow down options for radar systems and/or GPS, as well as get some kayak/boat options that look like promising designs.</p>
